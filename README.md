isotope-isotope_attribute_price
===============================

Creating variants for each product option can be a pain in Isotope. If you have a lot of variant combinations you are required to fill out a price for each variant you need.

This extension allows to add a price to Isotope attribute options. So if you add the attribute "size", you can specify that size M will be +10, and XXL will be +22,5 extra. This goes on top of the regular price.

To use add an attribute of the select type. The options field will have an extra field called price. You can use price as follows:

 * +10 => add 10 (euro, dollar, whatever your currency is)
 * -10 => substract 10
 * +10% => add 10 percent
 * 10 => add 10 (no operator will default to +)
